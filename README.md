## Description
The Note Taker app allows users to write new notes with a title and body, save their notes and retrieve them from the left-hand column of the page, as well as delete notes. Each note is saved to the database and deleted when the user interacts with the front-end trash icon.

## Usage
Users that visit the note-taking app are able to click into the notes page from the homepage, enter a title, body, and save their note. Saved notes are able to be retrieved from the left-hand menu, edited, or deleted.
